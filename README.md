# Library
Odin Project "Library"

Instructions and goals for this project can be found at "https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/library"

The main challenge for me was dynamically targeting items that don't "exist" in the DOM at page load.
I also learned creating objects dynamically and using their values.

I will be refactoring this project using Class while I'm learning JS Classes over the next few days.
