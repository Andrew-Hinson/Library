# Library Project
# Live site here: [Library](https://andrew-hinson.github.io/Library/)
## The Odin Project "Library"
* Instructions and goals for this project can be found at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/library)

## Concepts learned and utilized
* Intro to Classes and Factory Functions
* Dynamically creating and removing Objects
* Intro to Modules

## Final Thoughts:
The main challenge for me was dynamically targeting items that don't "exist" in the DOM at page load.
I also learned creating objects dynamically and using their values.

This Project has been refactored to use Class instead of Factory Functions per assignment in The Odin Project.
